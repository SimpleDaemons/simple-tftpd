# Simple TFTP Daemon - Honest Progress Report

**Date:** January 2025  
**Current Version:** 0.2.0-beta  
**Overall Project Completion:** ~82% of Production Version (Apache 2.0)  
**Product Versions:** Production (Apache 2.0), Enterprise (BSL 1.1 - Planned), Datacenter (BSL 1.1 - Planned)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We have a **working TFTP server** with core functionality and advanced features implemented. The server can handle TFTP read/write requests, support windowed transfers with sliding window, negotiate TFTP options (RFC 2347), provide comprehensive security features, and manage configuration with hot-reload support. The foundation is solid and most critical features for v0.2.0-beta are complete.

### What Works ✅
- UDP socket server (listening, accepting TFTP requests)
- Complete TFTP protocol implementation (RFC 1350)
- TFTP packet parsing and generation (RRQ, WRQ, DATA, ACK, ERROR, OACK)
- Windowed transfers with sliding window implementation
- TFTP options support (RFC 2347) - blksize, timeout, tsize, windowsize
- Retransmission logic with configurable retries and timeouts
- Duplicate packet detection
- Transfer modes (netascii, octet, mail)
- Path sanitization and directory traversal protection
- Access control (directory allowlists, file extension filtering, client allowlists)
- File restrictions (size limits, overwrite protection, read/write toggles)
- Multi-format configuration (JSON, YAML, INI)
- Configuration serialization (save/load)
- Configuration hot-reload via SIGHUP
- Logging system (multiple levels)
- Build system (CMake, Makefile)
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Test framework (Google Test integration)

### What's Pending/Incomplete ⚠️
- **Memory Leak Detection Execution** - Infrastructure ready, needs execution
- **Performance Testing Execution** - Framework exists, needs execution and documentation
- **Error Handling Review** - Exists throughout codebase, needs comprehensive review
- **Performance Optimization** - Basic optimization, needs enhancement (v0.3.0)
- **Web Management Interface** - Not implemented (v0.4.0)
- **SNMP Integration** - Not implemented (v0.4.0)
